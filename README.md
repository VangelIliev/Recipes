This is my defense project for ASP.NET Core course at SoftUni

Recipes is a platform for creating and sharing your favourite recipes.
At the website you can create your own recipes which can be edited and deleted only by you.
You can like other users recipes and comment them.
When you comment a recipe a alert shows up at real time to show to other users that you added a comment and to which recipe.
The project has different roles which give a different experience in the website;
There is a administrator panel to manage users and recipes.
Also you can send us email about a problem or just to ask something in the contact form.
